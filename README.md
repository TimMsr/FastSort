Instructions for running the code:
1. Clone the repository or save the file under FastSort.java
2. Compile the code: javac FastSort.java
3. Run the code: java FastSort

To reproduce the results:
If the code is cloned, the benchmark tests will be already included, so the only thing needed to do is run the code.
Otherwise, 
1. set the input size that the sort algorithm should sort (10,100,1000,10000)
2. Set the number of iterations (in our case 1000), which can be set to any value you would like, the higher the number of iterations the more accurate the average will be.
3. Maintain the same random range (-10000,10000), which has to be 5 digits as stated in the paper.
